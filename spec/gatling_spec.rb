  As a developer
  I want to run UI visual tests on my app
  So I can detect visual defects as soon as I create them 
}

  before(:all) do
    @expected_image = 
    @page_to_capture = 
  
  end
  
  
  describe 'creating an initial reference (expected) image' do
    pending
  end
  
  describe 'captured and referenced images match' do
    pending
  end
  
  describe 'captured and referenced images do NOT match' do
    pending
  end
